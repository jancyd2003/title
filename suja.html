        Snow is precipitation that forms when water vapor in clouds freezes and falls as ice crystals. Snowflakes can form when ice crystals stick together in clouds, and then fall to the ground if they are heavy enough. 
        Types of snow
        There are three main types of snow: light, moderate, and heavy. Light snow is the most common and usually falls in the morning or evening. 
        Snow's impact
        Snow can affect climate and weather, and is a vital source of drinking water and hydropower. Snowfall can also be a hydrological hazard, affecting transport routes, crops, and people. 
        Snow activities
        Snow can be fun to play in, and there are many activities you can do in the snow, such as building snowmen, sledding, and making snowflakes.
